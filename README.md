# Duplicate-question
Duplicate Question Detection (NLP):
Developed an NLP-based project focused on identifying duplicate question pairs. Leveraged Jupyter Notebook for in-depth data analysis and model creation to determine question pair duplicity.

Advanced NLP Techniques:
Applied advanced Natural Language Processing techniques, including text preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms, to accurately classify question pairs as duplicate or non-duplicate.

Data-Driven Insights:
Extracted meaningful insights from the data analysis, enhancing model performance. Achieved project goals through effective data exploration and model optimization.
